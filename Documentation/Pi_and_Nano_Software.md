# Getting the New Nano+Pi Zero to do some stuff

We will use a low overhead serial protocol based on the command line here https://github.com/robzed/ukmarsey

Please visit that project for details - this what needs to be programmed into the Arduino Nano for the robot to function.

The Python program in this project will talk to that software.
